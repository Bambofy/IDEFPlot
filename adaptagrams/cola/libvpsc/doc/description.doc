libvpsc is a cross-platform C++ library for solving for the Variable Placement with Separation Constraints problem. This is a quadratic programming problem in which the squared differences between a placement vector and some ideal placement are minimised subject to a set of separation constraints. This is very useful in a number of layout problems.

libvpsc is part of the 
<a href="http://www.adaptagrams.org/">Adaptagrams project</a>. 
There are no official releases yet, though the code is stable and 
available from the Adaptagrams 
<a href="https://github.com/mjwybrow/adaptagrams">GitHub 
repository</a>.

The API is documented using Doxygen.  The documentation you are currently 
reading can be obtained by running doxygen in the cola directory. 

libcola is written and maintained by 
<a href="http://users.monash.edu/~mwybrow/">Michael Wybrow</a> and

The algorithms used for VPSC are described in the following papers.  If you use libcola, please cite the relevant paper.
