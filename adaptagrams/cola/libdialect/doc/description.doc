libdialect is a cross-platform C++ library providing extensions to the libvpsc, libcola and libavoid libraries to support automatic generation of human-like orthogonal network (DiAlEcT) layouts via the following steps: D = Decompose/Distribute; A = Arrange; E = Expand/Emend; and T = Transform.

libdialect is part of the 
<a href="http://www.adaptagrams.org/">Adaptagrams project</a>. 
There are no official releases yet, though the code is stable and 
available from the Adaptagrams 
<a href="https://github.com/mjwybrow/adaptagrams">GitHub 
repository</a>.

The API is documented using Doxygen.  The documentation you are currently 
reading can be obtained by running doxygen in the cola directory. 

libdialect is written by 
<a href="http://skieffer.info">Steve Kieffer</a> and
members of <a href="http://ialab.it.monash.edu/">Immersive Analytics Lab</a> at Monash University, Australia.
