     * We may need to route multiple times to ensure that at least two sides of each node are being used,
     * but in theory we should never have to route more than 4n+1 times.
     *
     *  Proof: We always begin with an initial routing. We want to show it could be necessary to re-route
     *  at most 4n times.
     *
     *  In order to see this, we first argue that the worst-case-scenario for any single node is that it
     *  require four routings. Consider then some node u all of whose edges have been routed to one side, s0. We
     *  then pick some edge e0 incident to u, say that it may not connect to side s0, and we re-route for the first time.
     *
     *  While unlikely, it could be that, for whatever reason, now all edges incident to node u are routed to some other side,
     *  s1. We then pick some edge e1 (could be the same or different from e0), forbid it from connecting to
     *  side s1, and re-route for a second time.
     *
     *  Again, for whatever reason, all edges could now connect to one
     *  of the two remaining sides, s2. Continuing in this way, we could be led to re-route a third and a fourth time. But
     *  prior to the fourth re-routing it would be the case that for each side si of node u, there was
     *  some edge ei incident to u that had been forbidden from connecting on side si. Therefore on the fourth
     *  re-routing it would be impossible for all edges to connect on any single side of u.
     *
     *  So much for the case of a single node. However, in again a highly unlikely worst-case-scenario, it could be
     *  that during the first five routings no other node besides u was a pseudoleaf (had all edges routed to one side),
     *  but after the fifth some other node became a pseudoleaf. In this way we could be led to do four re-routings
     *  for each node in the graph. QED
     *
     * In practice, it would probably be very rare for more that two routings to ever be necessary. For this
     * requires the odd circumstance, considered in the proof, that forbidding one edge from connecting on a
     * given side somehow results in /all/ edges incident at that node migrating to some other, single side.
     *
     * In order that our theory be tested, we use an infinite loop with counter and assertion, instead
     * of a mere for-loop which would fail silently.
