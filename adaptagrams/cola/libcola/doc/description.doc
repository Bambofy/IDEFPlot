libcola is a cross-platform C++ library for constraint graph layout. Specifically, force-directed layout using the stress-majorization method subject to separation constraints. Applications include layout with non-overlapping nodes and clusters, directed graph layout and layout preserving the crossing properties of a given starting layout.

libcola is part of the 
<a href="http://www.adaptagrams.org/">Adaptagrams project</a>. 
There are no official releases yet, though the code is stable and 
available from the Adaptagrams 
<a href="https://github.com/mjwybrow/adaptagrams">GitHub 
repository</a>.

The API is documented using Doxygen.  The documentation you are currently 
reading can be obtained by running doxygen in the cola directory. 

libcola is written and maintained by 
<a href="http://users.monash.edu/~mwybrow/">Michael Wybrow</a> and
<a href="http://ialab.it.monash.edu/~dwyer/">Tim Dwyer</a>,
members of <a href="http://ialab.it.monash.edu/">Immersive Analytics Lab</a> at Monash University, Australia.
